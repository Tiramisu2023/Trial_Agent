## Introduction to the Trial Agent

we present the design and implementation of a groundbreaking Trial Agent, tailored specifically for the clinical trial domain, which leverages the **LangChain** framework and harnesses the power of **GPT-4** as its underlying large language model (LLM). This innovative agent is a first-of-its-kind application in the clinical trial domain, conceived from the perspective of a statistical programmer to autonomously tackle complex analytical tasks. 


The Trial Agent demonstrates the ability to autonomously decompose tasks, reason, plan, and execute actions by leveraging provided tools. It represents a significant advancement in the clinical trial arena by embedding LLM functionalities into the workflow, which paves the way for a potential autonomous analysis robot. This Agent emerges as a powerful assistant to statisticians, medical professionals, and statistical programmers, collaboratively enhancing their capacity for in-depth data analysis.

## Demonstration
A demostration of a common example how the Trial Agent received a request from user, breaks down tasks, utilizes tools, and progressively finishes minor objectives to accomplish an assignment in 4 rounds is shown here:
